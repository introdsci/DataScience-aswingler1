For this phase of the project I want use the the data I scraped from Pew Research Centers website that has the immigration information of congresspeople in the House and the Senate.
One question I want to answer is weather there is a corelation between a congressperson being a immigrant and their party and how they vote on bills.

115th:

116th:

```{r}

congress115 <- read_html("https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/21/immigrants-or-children-of-immigrants-make-up-at-least-12-of-congress/")
